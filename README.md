# Intelligent Skincare Product Recommendation System

> **Abstract** : In todayâ€™s expansive skincare market, consumers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of products and conflicting advice on what works for specific skin concerns. People often end up purchasing skincare items through trial and error, which can lead to wasted money, skin irritation, and long-term dissatisfaction. To address this issue, we propose developing an intelligent Skincare Product Recommendation System that can suggest personalized skincare solutions based on individual skin types, concerns, and preferences. This system aims to simplify the product selection process by using a combination of user input, dermatological insights, and machine learning techniques.
